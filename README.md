# An Introductory Guide to ChromaDB and Elasticsearch  

This project provides a hands-on guide to creating, reading, updating, deleting, and searching data in the vector databases **ChromaDB** and **Elasticsearch**.  

Additionally, it demonstrates how to build a more advanced system with multiple collections to enhance the retriever component of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models**.  

Finally, it's important to note that vector databases are not only useful for **large language models (LLMs)** but also for deep learning models requiring similarity search in large datasets. For instance, they can be leveraged in **Siamese Networks for Customer Similarity Analysis**.
